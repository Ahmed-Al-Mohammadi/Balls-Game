# Balls-Game
 is a Python script that implements an interactive hand punch game using computer vision and pygame. Here's a brief explanation of its key components and functionality:

1- The game uses OpenCV (cv2) for video capture and MediaPipe for hand tracking.
2- Pygame is used to create the game window and handle graphics.
3- The game displays the webcam feed and overlays green balls falling from the top of the screen.
4- It detects hand movements using MediaPipe's hand tracking capabilities.
5- Players can "punch" the falling balls by moving their hand upwards.
6- When a ball is successfully punched, it disappears and the player's score increases.
7 The game continuously updates the ball positions, checks for collisions, and refreshes the display.
8- The player's current score is shown on the screen.
This interactive game combines real-time hand tracking with simple game mechanics, creating an engaging experience where players use their hands to interact with virtual objects on the screen.
